A friend that keeps you on your toes.

# Project Description
 A Tingo is a friend on my phone.  Similar to a Tamagotchi, I need to take care of it with exercise, meals, and sleep.  Tingos do everything with me so if i'm sleeping, then they are too.  This encourages me to eat healthy, go to the gym and get enough sleep.  Healthy Tingos can level up and get items.
 Tingos can understand what I say and follow basic instructions using our own speech recognition algorithm.  Eventually, Tingos will be able to hold a basic conversation.
# Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
 The minimal viable product for this app will include:
  - A UI where users can see their Tingo and its health stats
  - Connectivity with Google Fit API's to track steps, affecting Tingo health
  - Performing actions based off of what was said based off machiene learning
  - App created through Unity that will be on Android

# Add-on Features
 - Tracking sleep and diet to effect Tingo health
 - Collectable items and wearables earned from leveling up
 - IOS Version

 # User Story

When I open the app, I will be able to see my Tingo and its health.  It's health is linked to the number of steps I have taken that day.  If the I do not hit enough steps, the Tingo will lose health until it dies, at which point I can make a new Tingo.  If I go over my step amount, the Tingo will gain XP and can level up.

It will also be possible to talk to the Tingo and have it react to the words that I say.  It can make noises or move around the room based off my voice input.
